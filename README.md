# Semusi-Case-Study
Problem Statement:
You, as the Security analyst, at Stark Industries, have been tasked to build a new contactless employee check-in system. Currently the employees use a physical keycard for entry into the building like shown below. 
You have come up with a new idea that uses the employees smartphone and machine learning to provide a contactless system where when an employee enters the firm's territory, his or her smartphone connects to the server and transmits data from the employee smartphone sensor data like the accelerometer's data. The server performs the calculations and determines this person as one of the employees using Gait analysis. Essentially it compares the current pattern of the employee's gait with the historial pattern and if there is a match, the doors automatically open for the employee to walk in. 

Approach:
1. Data Collection: Utilize the Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite or similar apps to collect sensor data from the smartphones of employees while they walk. This data will include accelerometer readings, gyroscope readings, and possibly magnetometer readings.
2.Preprocessing: Clean the raw sensor data by removing noise, filtering out irrelevant information, and ensuring uniform sampling rates. Convert the sensor data into a format suitable for analysis, such as time-series data.
3. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed sensor data that capture the unique characteristics of each individual's gait. These features could include temporal characteristics, frequency-domain features, statistical measures, etc.
4. Building a Model: Train a machine learning model using the extracted features and historical gait data of employees. Popular models for this task include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, or even deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using validation techniques such as cross-validation or by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Measure metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's effectiveness.
6. Deployment: Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, deploy it to the server where real-time data from employees' smartphones can be processed. Integrate the model into the contactless employee check-in system, ensuring seamless operation and minimal latency.
7. Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the system's performance in real-world scenarios and collect feedback to fine-tune the model if necessary. Regular maintenance and updates may be required to adapt to changes in the environment or employee behavior.

# Step 1: Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('employee_gait_data.csv')

# Step 2: Preprocessing
# Assume data is already preprocessed and features are extracted

# Step 3: Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('employee_id', axis=1)  # Assuming 'employee_id' is not a feature
y = data['employee_id']

# Step 4: Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Build a Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 6: Evaluate the Random Forest model
rf_predictions = rf_model.predict(X_test)
rf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_predictions)
print("Random Forest Accuracy:", rf_accuracy)

# Step 7: Build a deep learning model using TensorFlow/Keras
input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
num_classes = len(y.unique())

dl_model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

dl_model.compile(optimizer='adam',
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
dl_model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2)

# Step 8: Evaluate the deep learning model
dl_loss, dl_accuracy = dl_model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print("Deep Learning Accuracy:", dl_accuracy)


Certainly! Below is a Python code snippet demonstrating how to build a machine learning model for gait analysis using the Random Forest classifier from scikit-learn:

python

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Step 1: Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('employee_gait_data.csv')

# Step 2: Preprocessing
# Assume data is already preprocessed and features are extracted

# Step 3: Split data into features (X) and target (y)
X = data.drop('employee_id', axis=1)  # Assuming 'employee_id' is not a feature
y = data['employee_id']

# Step 4: Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 5: Build a Random Forest model
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

Remarks:
This code snippet demonstrates how to load the dataset, preprocess it (assuming it's already preprocessed), split it into training and testing sets, build a Random Forest model, and evaluate its accuracy.
To run this code, you'll need to have the necessary libraries installed (pandas, scikit-learn). Make sure to replace 'employee_gait_data.csv' with the actual path to your dataset file.
The output of this code snippet will be the accuracy of the Random Forest model on the test dataset.
